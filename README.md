# reusable-actions

This is my own actions library.
Whenever possible I use the here defined actions to keep all in one place.

## Auto update

The library auto-updates itself to keep up to date with the latest actions.

## Actions

### Reusable workflows

### Composits

#### create-release-pr

This action is intended to be used in a separate file of your CI.
The composite will create a PR for a release, if your repo follows semantic-commits.

#### megalint

Features a full blown linter collection. Check out the folks at: [megalint](https://megalinter.github.io)
